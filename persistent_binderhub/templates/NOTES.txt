Thank you for installing Persistent BinderHub!

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }} and installed into the namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}.

You can find if the hub and proxy is ready by doing:

 kubectl get pod --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} --watch

and watching for both those pods to be in status 'Running'.

You can find the public IP of the JupyterHub by doing:

 kubectl get svc proxy-public --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }}

It might take a few minutes for it to appear!

Note that this is still an alpha release! If you have questions, feel free to
